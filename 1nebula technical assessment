QUESTION 2

SCRIPT

// I Created the Employee table from the CSV file i was given

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT,
    Birthday DATE,
    Active BOOLEAN,
    Street VARCHAR(100),
    Postal VARCHAR(10),
    Province VARCHAR(50),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    Longitude FLOAT,
    Latitude FLOAT,
    PackageID UUID,
    VendorID UUID,
    Phone VARCHAR(15),
    PackageCost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    ContractStart DATE,
    ContractEnd DATE
);

// This will Update all emails to have 'company' as the host,as it be keeping the domain unchanged
UPDATE Employee
SET Email = 
    CONCAT(
        SUBSTRING(Email, 1, POSITION('@' IN Email) - 1),
        '@company',
        SUBSTRING(Email, POSITION('.' IN Email), LENGTH(Email))
    );

Question 1

public string Likes(List<string> names)
{
    // Get the number of names in the list
    int count = names.Count;

    // switch statement to determine the appropriate message based on the count of names
    switch (count)
    {
        case 0:
            // If there are no names, return this message
            return "no one likes this";
        case 1:
            // If there is one name, it will return that name with the message
            return $"{names[0]} likes this";
        case 2:
            // If there are two names, it will return both names with the message
            return $"{names[0]} and {names[1]} like this";
        case 3:
            // If there are three names, it will return all three names with the message
            return $"{names[0]}, {names[1]} and {names[2]} like this";

Front-end Code Challenges
Question 1
1. What will the color of both div elements be?
firstDiv: Red
secondDiv: Orange. //The first div will be red because of the red-card class, and the second div will be orange because its ID-specific style overrides the class.

2. How would you dynamically target firstDiv and make its color pink?
document.getElementById("firstDiv").style.backgroundColor = "pink";
3. How would you dynamically target secondDiv and add the yellow-card class to its class list?
document.getElementById("secondDiv").classList.add("yellow-card");
